# Drowsy-detector
This is the python implementation for detecting drowsynes using dlib libraray and Facial landmark library using openCV library. I have used eye aspect ration and mouth aspect ration to detect clossing of eyes and yawning.

I have used Anaconda navigator and created virtual environment in anaconda as some of the python libraries was not working in windows and asks for wheel update.
